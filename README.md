# Java dataframes test
This is the companion repository to the following medium post: [Doing cool data science in Java: how 3 DataFrame libraries stackÂ up](https://medium.com/@thijser/doing-cool-data-science-in-java-how-3-dataframe-libraries-stack-up-5e6ccb7b437)

## Data
The data was extracted from [Eurostat](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_cpop1&lang=en) in the beginning of September 2018. I opened the extracted CSV in LibreOffice and saved it again because there were some illegal UTF-8 characters in the Eurostat output that some csv importers couldn't handle directly.

## Code
The code for the three libraries is present in the `Test{libraryname}.java` files. They all use `CheckResult.java` to do a basic correctness check for the top-growing cities.

The libraries tested fully are:
* [tablesaw](https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw)
* [joinery](https://github.com/cardillo/joinery)
* [morpheus](https://github.com/zavtech/morpheus-core)

As described in the [medium post](https://medium.com/@thijser/doing-cool-data-science-in-java-how-3-dataframe-libraries-stack-up-5e6ccb7b437), I couldn't find a good way to do the pivot step in [datavec](https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/datavec-overview), but I included the code I wrote up until that point.
